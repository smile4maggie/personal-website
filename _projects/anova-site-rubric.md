The Underrepresented Minority (URM) School Searcher uses Python and the requests-html library to web scrape GreatSchools.org for public and charter schools in a desired city and state. The script returns a response listing all schools in the area with their racial demographics, low-income percentage, and english-language learning percentages. The list is then sorted by a custom ranking, where schools with higher rates of underrepresented minorities represent target sites that likely need more computer science resources.
