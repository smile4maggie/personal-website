BearMaps is a Java web-mapping application that uses real-world map data to visualize
roads, locations, and shortest paths. I built a QuadTree class to recursively store and return image tiles at the best resolutions for a given zoom depth, and incorporated shortest-path finding and autocomplete using the A* algorithm and Trie data structures.
