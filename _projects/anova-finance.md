The Automated Finance Web Form uses Selenium and the Google Sheets API to automatically fill out the purchase request web form on UC Berkeley's club finance page. I made requests to the response spreadsheet of a Google Form and used the XPath of web elements on the Callink page to insert matching data, reducing the average time for submitting a purchase request from 35s to 3s (-91%).
