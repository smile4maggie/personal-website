caption: I used to really hate Tong Yun Fou (Chinatown) as a kid. I hated the smelly fish markets, the leftover orange peels and lychee skins on the floor, the constant flux of old Asian grandparents yelling over whether or not a vegetable was fresh. But they always had great dim sum and man tou, and it was home to my favorite park, Fah Yoon Gok. I still have baby pictures on the yellow slides and metal monkeybars, and take pride in the fact that I know every street in the neighborhood.<br><br>After all this time, I've really grown to appreciate San Francisco's Chinatown. A lot has changed since I was younger â€” more shops have opened up to cater to tourists, and lack of police in the area leaves many small business owners vulnerable to robbery and theft.<br><br>But in spite of it all, Chinatown is like a second home to me; a place where I'm proud to understand and speak Cantonese, and a reflection of the every day hustle and hard work needed to support your family.
