title: First Semester Reflections, and Second Semester Hopes
---
It's a little weird knowing I've already finished my first semester at Cal. I remember back in high school when all I wanted was to go to the *~famous UC Berkeley~*, one of the highest ranked computer science universities in the world. I think it's one of those moments when you realize you're living what was once a distant and far-fetched dream and suddenly you feel old.<!--more--> I was right, though. Cal truly lives up to its name, and I can't imagine myself getting an education anywhere else.
<br>
<br>
That doesn't mean I didn't struggle though! There were countless moments where I felt discouraged, angry, anxious, and disappointed. For the first time in a very long time, I temporarily gave up on myself and settled for mediocracy. Math, for example, has been my favorite core subject for a very long time; I knew I loved numbers since kindergarten's 1 + 1 (= window) all the way through high school calculus. But Math 1B at Cal? A completely different story! Talk about impossible integrals and catastrophic chaos. Series convergence and divergence tests were a mess, and to this day I still don't understand why we needed to learn the Monotonic Convergence Theorem. At some point during the middle of the semester (right after I received my Midterm 2 score, to be specific), I lost my way, and had a serious anxiety attack in my dorm. How was it possible that I could study so, so hard, and still only get an average score? Was there something wrong with me?
<br>
<br>
Of course, there was nothing wrong with me. I had to get used to the fact that everyone at Berkeley was hard-working and smart â€” exactly what I had read about during my high school days on College Confidential. Math 1B was not my favorite class, but I will say it was a genuinely humbling experience, and when I finished my exam at the end of the semester, I was so proud of myself. I knew I didn't get a perfect score, but I felt like I deeply and thoroughly understood every topic. This probably makes me sound lame, but I literally walked out of VLSB with a smile on my face listening to "Put Me Down" by Aquilo (Highly recommend, btw).
<br>
<br>
This brings me to my first life lesson of Fall 2016:

>**Stop comparing yourself to other people.
Focus on your own achievements and how they shape who you are.**

This is so important. I can't stress it enough, especially to myself. It's hard not to compare myself to others, and I'm sure many people can agree with me. Coming from a low-income, first-generation college student background, I had to recognize that it was not fair to be so down on myself all the time; I should be proud that I managed to get this far despite my circumstances. Proudest B. Ever.

<br>
Now, moving on to what was most important to me academically: CS 61A with John DeNero. He was the epitome of a college professor - enthusiastic, inspiring, brilliant, and even a little quirky. He's the star of UC Berkeley's meme page and half the submissions to the Scheme Recursive Art Contest; Seeing him on campus is like seeing the Michael Jackson of celebrities: a serious legend. Taking 61A only further confirmed that I loved computer science, and proved that Berkeley's EECS/CS department is as great as everyone says it is.
<br>
<br>
However, it being such a wonderful program, it's also extremely difficult. And at times, even a bit overwhelming. CS 61A is the largest undergraduate course at Cal, with nearly 1600 students enrolled a semester! That's crazy! (Do I say "that's crazy" a lot? I feel like I do. Everything's just crazy.) It's interesting though because despite it being such a large class, I feel like I had all the necessary resources to really understand the material and succeed.
