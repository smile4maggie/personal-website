title: Love and Affection
---
I find it difficult to grasp what affection, loyalty, and unconditional love for someone really means. How do you know if you like someone? What if it's just lust, or a desperate desire to find a companion in such a big world?<!--more-->
<br><br>
Is there something wrong with me?
<br>
Maybe.
<br><br>
Sometimes I wish people could read my mind. There are so many things I want to say, to fluently express to people I care about and like.
<br><br>
But I don't know how to reciprocate affection. One of my closest friends Katie once told me that "touch is not my love language." For some reason, that really stood out to me. It was like she was defining and giving meaning to a part of me I didn't have the words for.
<br><br>
And most of the time, I can see how that makes other people feel unwanted, or maybe a little uncomfortable and confused. They think I'm either not interested, or that I feel awkward.
<br><br>
But I do like you! And I love your presence! And your hugs and warmth and laugh and the quirkiest parts of you that you hate about yourself!
<br><br>
And even if I might not hug back as hard, or smile all the time, or seem excited to see you...
<br><br>
I really really really do like you. I swear I swear. I just need you to give me the time and comfort to show it.
<br>
<br>
I promise I'll love you really hard.
