title: Setting Up my Website
---
I literally just spent the past 2 days trying to make my website/portfolio. I'm feeling pretty happy about what I've created though. At first, I only had a static website with simple pages that redirected to one another. Now, I even have a working blog!

I first tried learning Django and Flask, but I had a hard time with their installation process and combing through their documentation. I think I'll go back to them another time but I wanted to get my website up and running quickly before I go back to school in a week and a half.

That's where Jekyll came in. I somehow managed to figure out how to use it in one day, which is pretty amazing. I think the most important part I've taken away from it is something they call "layouts", which is a lot like template inheritance. It's nice to be able to find parts of my website that were repeated and create a page.html template for it, then use Liquid to code the unique parts of every page.

It's definitely not perfect yet, and there's still a lot I have to work on, but I'm proud of what I've made so far! It's now 1:39 AM, I should probably get some sleep.
