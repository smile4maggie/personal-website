<h5>It’s a little weird knowing I’ve already finished my first semester at Cal. I remember back in high school when all I wanted was to go to the <em>~famous UC Berkeley~</em>, one of the highest ranked computer science universities in the world. I think it’s one of those moments when you realize you’re living what was once a distant and far-fetched dream and suddenly you feel old.<!--more--> I was right, though. Cal truly lives up to its name, and I can’t imagine myself getting an education anywhere else.
<br />
<br />
That doesn’t mean I didn’t struggle though! There were countless moments where I felt discouraged, angry, anxious, and disappointed. For the first time in a very long time, I temporarily gave up on myself and settled for mediocracy. Math, for example, has been my favorite core subject for a very long time; I knew I loved numbers since kindergarten’s 1 + 1 (= window) all the way through high school calculus. But Math 1B at Cal? A completely different story! Talk about impossible integrals and catastrophic chaos. Series convergence and divergence tests were a mess, and to this day I still don’t understand why we needed to learn the Monotonic Convergence Theorem. At some point during the middle of the semester (right after I received my Midterm 2 score, to be specific), I lost my way, and had a serious anxiety attack in my dorm. How was it possible that I could study so, so hard, and still only get a barely average score? Was there something wrong with me?
<br />
<br />
Of course, there was nothing wrong with me. I had to get used to the fact that everyone at Berkeley was hard-working and smart — exactly what I had read about during my high school days on College Confidential. Math 1B was not my favorite class, but I will say it was a genuinely humbling experience, and when I finished my exam at the end of the semester, I was so proud of myself. I knew I didn’t get a perfect score, but I felt like I deeply and thoroughly understood every topic. This probably makes me sound lame, but I literally walked out of VLSB with a smile on my face listening to “Put Me Down” by Aquilo (Highly recommend, btw).
<br />
<br />
This brings me to my first life lesson of Fall 2016:

<blockquote>
  <strong>Stop comparing yourself to other people.
Focus on your own achievements and how they shape who you are.</strong>
</blockquote>

This is so important. I can’t stress it enough, especially to myself. It’s hard not to compare myself to others, and I’m sure many people can agree with me.
