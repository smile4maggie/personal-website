  <h1 class="title"">ABOUT</h1>
  <h5>
    I'm Maggie, a fourth-year Computer Science major at UC Berkeley interested in computer security, educational technology, and software development for non-profit organizations. I was a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon in Seattle, WA on the Service Frameworks team during Summer 2018. I am currently a Software Engineer Intern at Uber in Seattle, WA on the Secrets & Encryption team.

  <h5>
    I'm passionate about community outreach and narrowing the education and gender gap in technology. I encourage young women to pursue careers in tech through organizations like Girls Who Code, and teach computer science at under-resourced public schools in the Bay Area with Berkeley ANova.

    I also enjoy boxing, watching tv, and playing acoustic guitar. You'll always catch me listening to Wet, Oh Wonder, or The Internet while sipping coffee at my favorite cafe.
