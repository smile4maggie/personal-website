  <h5>
    I'm Maggie, a third-year Computer Science major and Art History minor at UC Berkeley interested in computer security and educational technology. I'm currently a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon in Seattle, WA working on the Consumer Cloud Enablement team.
  </h5>
  <h5>
    I'm passionate about community outreach and narrowing the education and gender gap in technology. I encourage young women to pursue careers in tech through organizations like Girls Who Code, and teach computer science at under-resourced public schools in the Bay Area with Berkeley ANova.
  </h5>
  <h5>
    I also enjoy bagels, watching tv, and playing acoustic guitar. You'll always catch me listening to HONNE, Oh Wonder, or The Internet while sipping coffee at my favorite cafe.
