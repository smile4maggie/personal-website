  <h5>
    I'm Maggie, a software engineer at Afterpay on the Risk Engineering team. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Computer Science and enjoy full-stack/back-end web development, educational policy, and using technology for social good. Previously, I was a Software Engineer Intern at Uber on the Secrets & Encryption team and a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon on the Service Frameworks team.

  <h5>
    I'm passionate about community outreach and narrowing the racial, gender, and socioeconomic gap in computer science education. I also enjoy boxing, art history, and playing acoustic guitar. You'll always catch me listening to Jhene Aiko, Oh Wonder, or The Internet while sipping coffee from my french press.
