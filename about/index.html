  <h5>
    I'm Maggie, a second-year Computer Science and Art History student at UC Berkeley. While I'm still exploring the field and what it has to offer, I'm especially interested in machine learning, NLP, data science, and software development. I was an academic intern for CS 61A this past semester.
  </h5>
  <h5>
    I'm passionate about community outreach and narrowing the education and gender gap in technology. I encourage young women to pursue careers in tech through organizations like Girls Who Code, and teach computer science at under-resourced public schools in the Bay Area with Berkeley ANova.
  </h5>
  <h5>
    I also enjoy bagels, graphic design, and playing acoustic guitar. You'll always catch me listening to HONNE, Oh Wonder, and Cigarettes After Sex while chugging my coffee or milk tea.
