  <h5>
    I'm Maggie, a first-year Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. While I'm still exploring the field and what it has to offer, I'm especially interested in machine learning, cybersecurity, data science, and software development. I'm currently an academic intern for CS 61A: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

    I'm passionate about community outreach and narrowing the gender gap in technology. I encourage young women to pursue careers in tech through organizations like Girls Who Code, and teach computer science at under-resourced public schools in the Bay Area with Berkeley ANova.

    I also enjoy photography, graphic design, and playing acoustic guitar. You'll always catch me listening to HONNE and Oh Wonder while sipping on a good 'ol cup of coffee.
